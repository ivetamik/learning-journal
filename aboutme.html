                    <h1>Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                    <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump
                        over
                        to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded
                        peers.

            <h2 class="h2-space">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try
                to
                create simple
                projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.

                <span class="space-p">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was
                    learning and most
                    things about my journey with the world.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>How I got started</h2>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
                learning. After each
                learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
                summaries
                of what I
                learned using my own words.

                <span class="space-p">That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
                    learning
                    summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</span>
